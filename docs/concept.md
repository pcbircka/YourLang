# Problems

## Traditional language learning apps don't take into account the user's personal context
Most platforms (Duolingo, Memrise, Babbel) provide pre-compiled lessons and dictionaries. The user learns other people's words, which are not always necessary for him personally. Speech and thinking remain "artificial," and progress in conversational practice is slow.

## Lack of natural oral experience
Speaking practice is often limited to tests or repetition of ready-made phrases. Real live speech is hardly analyzed or transformed into personal materials.

## Poor vocabulary personalization
Words and phrases do not adapt to topics that are interesting to a particular user. The user has to find for himself which words are useful for work, hobbies or communication.

## Lack of motivation and immersion
Repeating boilerplate words and sentences quickly gets boring. There is no sense of "my personal language" that grows with your interests and experiences.

Existing methods create learning "for everyone," not "for me."
The user learns the language formally, without getting involved in live speech and without creating a personal dictionary.
This reduces efficiency and motivation.


# Decision:

## A personal dictionary based on your speech
The user answers questions verbally in their native language. The system records audio, turns it into text, and analyzes keywords, topics, and phrases. Based on these words, a personal dictionary is formed in the language being studied, including translations, idioms, and thematically related words. The dictionary grows with the user, reflecting their interests, experiences, and habits.

## Natural Oral Practice
Unlike template exercises, the user learns through their own answers. The system adapts materials to real speech, helping to develop pronunciation, vocabulary and thinking in a new language.

## Dynamic generation of lessons and flashcards
Each new word or expression is automatically added to exercises, examples, and dialogues. The user receives individual tasks that are based on their own experience, rather than on ready-made scenarios.

## Contextual coupling and thematic expansion
In addition to the words from the user's answers, the system adds related words and expressions, expanding the vocabulary on the topic. For example, if the user was talking about “fishing", the words “fishing rod", “caught", “shore”, etc. will appear in the language being studied.

## Motivation through personal language skills
The user sees how his own language is formed: a set of words and expressions that he really needs. This approach increases engagement and accelerates language acquisition.

YourLang turns the user's personal experience and speech into educational material.
This ensures that learning is as natural, personalized, and motivating as possible, which traditional apps do not provide.
